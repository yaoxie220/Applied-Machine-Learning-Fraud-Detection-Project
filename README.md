# aml_final_project
This is the final project for the Applied Machine Learning at Columbia

Things to keep in Mind:-
1. You can use requirements.txt if you want the exact packages that we might use.
2. You can put the csv files into .gitignore so that you don't push the large csv's everytime.
3. Try to work on a seperate branch and merge into the main one, while taking a pull from the main one to maintain the latest code.
